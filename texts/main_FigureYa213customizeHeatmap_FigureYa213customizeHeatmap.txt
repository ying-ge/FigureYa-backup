Figure 6. Identification of most promising therapeutic agents for
high PPS score patients according to the
evidence from multiple
sources
(see also Table S15 available online at
https://academic.oup.com/bib
).
Six CTRP-derived
agents
and
six PRISM-derived agents
were shown
on the
left
and
right
of the diagram,
respectively.
FigureYa131CMap也用到了CMap，并对感兴趣的小分子进行MoA药物作用机制分析，可相互参考。
CMap is also used in FigureYa131CMap, and MoA drug mechanism of
action analysis is performed on the small molecule of interest, which
can be cross-referenced.
应用场景
例文采用了多个来源的数据相互佐证，来说明筛选出的化合物/药物的潜在价值。作者设计了这个图，巧妙地把证据一、二、三和四同时展示出来，同时还能看到overlap。
证据一和二：上文用PRISM和CTRP发现了12个 candidate compounds
identified showed a higher drug sensitivity in PPS score-high
patients（可参考FigureYa212drugTarget）
证据三：We first used the
CMap analysis
to find
compounds of which gene expression patterns were oppositional to the
HCC-specific expression patterns (i.e. gene expression increased in
tumor tissues but decreased by treatment of certain compounds).
证据四：Secondly,
fold-change differences of the expression
levels (including mRNA- and protein-level) of candidates’ drug
targets
between tumor and normal tissue were calculated, and a
higher fold change value indicated a greater potential of candidate
agent for HCC treatment.
证据五：Thirdly, a comprehensive
literature search
was performed in PubMed (
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
. gov/pubmed/) to find out the
experimental and clinical evidence of candidate compounds in treating
HCC.
Application Scenarios
Data from multiple sources are used to corroborate each other to
illustrate the potential value of the screened compounds/drugs. The
author has designed this diagram to cleverly display evidence one, two,
three, and four at the same time, while also seeing the overlap.
Evidence 1 & 2: 12 candidate compounds identified showed a
higher drug sensitivity in PPS score-high patients using PRISM and CTRP
above (see FigureYa212drugTarget)
Evidence 3: We first used the
CMap analysis
to find
compounds of which gene expression patterns were oppositional to the
HCC-specific expression patterns (i.e. gene expression increased in
tumor tissues but decreased by treatment of certain compounds).
Evidence 4: Secondly,
fold-change differences of the
expression levels (including mRNA- and protein-level) of candidates’
drug targets
between tumor and normal tissue were calculated,
and a higher fold change value indicated a greater potential of
candidate agent for HCC treatment.
Evidence 5: Thirdly, a comprehensive
literature
search
was performed in PubMed (
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
. gov/pubmed/) to find out the
experimental and clinical evidence of candidate compounds in treating
HCC.
下面将带你实现CMap analysis及画图。以左图CTRP
vs. CMap为例，右图也是一样的。
使用本代码或分析思路请引用：
The following will take you through the implementation of CMap
analysis and drawing. Take CTRP vs. CMap on the left as an example, and
the same is true for the right.

CMap 分析
生成CMap的输入文件
根据原文补充材料的描述：300 genes with the most significant fold
changes (150 up-regulated genes and 150 down-regulated genes) were
submitted to the CMap website
https://clue.io/query
CMap analysis
Generate input files for CMap
According to the original supplemental description: 300 genes with
the most significant fold changes (150 up-regulated genes and 150
down-regulated genes) were submitted to the CMap website
https://clue.io/query
ngene <- 150
degs <- na.omit(resData[order(resData$log2fc,decreasing = T),])
updegs <- rownames(degs)[1:ngene]
dndegs <- rownames(degs)[(nrow(degs)-ngene + 1):nrow(degs)]
cmap.input <- data.frame(up = updegs,
                         dn = dndegs,
                         stringsAsFactors = F)
write.table(cmap.input,"CMap_input.txt",sep = "\t",row.names = F,col.names = T,quote = F)
CMap网站使用
输入CMap_input.txt，经过以下方法获得CMap_export.txt文件，用于下一步画图。
CMap Website Usage
Enter the CMap_input.txt and go through the following method to
obtain a CMap_export.txt file for the next step of drawing.
开始画图
图分为左中右三部分，左侧区块相当于annotation，中间为基因变化倍数，右侧为CMap
score。
把annotation、log2FC、以及前面计算得到的CMap score填进去。
这里直接把数值写入矩阵matrix，实际使用时可通过读入存储相应数值的文件来赋值。
Start drawing
The figure is divided into three parts: left, middle and right, the
left block is equivalent to the annotation, the middle is the gene
change fold, and the right side is the CMap score.
Fill in the annotation, log2FC, and the CMap score calculated
earlier.
Here, the values are directly written into the matrix, and the values
can be assigned by reading into the file that stores the corresponding
values.
cmap.res <- read.delim("CMap_export.txt",sep = "\t",row.names = 1,check.names = F,stringsAsFactors = F,header = T)
drug <- c("BI-2536","Leptomycin B","methotrexate","narciclasine","SR-II-138A","vincristine")
selres <- cmap.res[which(cmap.res$Name %in% intersect(cmap.res$Name,drug)),]
print(selres)
下面根据这个结果构建matrix，用于绘制热图，分别准备：
伪数据[用于映射颜色]，dt
展示标签，lb
标签对应颜色，cl
Let’s build a matrix based on this result, which will be used to draw
a heat map, and prepare them separately:
Pseudo-data [for mapping colors], dt
Display labels, lb
The label corresponds to the color, cl
draw(hm)
dev.copy2pdf(file = "heatmap.pdf",width = 8,height = 8)
作者表示整张图片均由热图拼接AI绘制，这里输出的pdf文件是矢量图，图片剩余细节以及图例请使用AI绘制。
The author said that the whole picture is drawn by AI after the heat
map is stitched, and the pdf file output here is a vector image, and the
remaining details and legends of the picture should be drawn by AI. #
