  WARNING: GDCquery_Maf function not found!
✓ maftools is installed
  Package loads successfully
✓ MutationalPatterns is installed

Testing TCGAbiolinks functionality...
✗ GDCquery_Maf function NOT found
  Available functions containing 'Maf':
   No Maf-related functions found

===========================================
Some packages may have installation or loading issues.
If GDCquery_Maf is not available, try:
1. Updating TCGAbiolinks: BiocManager::install('TCGAbiolinks', update = TRUE)
2. Checking function name: some versions may use different function names
3. Consult TCGAbiolinks documentation for the correct function name
You can now run your R scripts in this directory.
